## Basic

```racket
# lang racket
#lang racket
(provide (all-defined-out))

;this is a comment

(define s "hello")

(define x 3)
(define y (+ x 2))

(define cube1
  (lambda (x)
    (* x (* x x))))

(define cube2
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x x)))

(define (cube3 x)
  (* x x x))

(define (pow1 x y)
  (if (=y 0)
      1
      (* x (pow1 x (- y 1)))))

; currying
(define pow2
  (lambda (x)
    (lambda (y)
      (pow1 x y))))

```

### List

* Empty list: `null`
	* `()` doesn"t work for `null` but `'()` does
* build a list: `(list e1 ... en)`
* Constructor: `cons`
* Access head of list: `car`
* Access tail of list: `cdr`
* Check for empty: `null?`

### Syntax

A term is either:
* An atom like `#t, #f, 34, "hi", null, 4.0, x,...`
* A special form like `define, lambda, if`
* A sequence of terms in parentheses: `(t1 t2 t3)`
* Can use `[` anything you use `(`

Remember parentheses matters! For example:
`(e)` means call e with 0 argument.

### Dynamic typing

```racket
(define lst (list #t "hi" 1 (list 2 3 4)))
```

### Cond

```racket
(define (sum3 xs)
  (cond [(null? xs) 0]
        [(number? (car xs)) (+ (car xs) (sum3 (cdr xs)))]
        [#t 0]))
```

### What is true?

Anything that is not `#f` is true `#t`.

### Local bindings

#### let/let*/letrec

```racket
(let ([x1 e1]
      [x2 e2]
      ...
      [xn en])
  e)
```

Racket uses the environment **before** the let-expression to evaluate `e1 e2 ... en`, which means if `en` uses `x1`, `x2`, that would mean some outer variables of the same name. Instead, the expressions in `let*` are evaluated in the environment produced from the previous bindings (later ones shadow) . 

The expressions in `letrec` are evaluated in the environment that includes all th bindings. It is needed for mutual recursion.

### set!

Racket has assignment statements:
```racket
(set! x e)
```

Once you have side-effects, sequences are useful:
